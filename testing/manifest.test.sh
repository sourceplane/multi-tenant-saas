# The manifest must state what THE BLUEPRINT does (saas-bootstrap-console
# BC2/BC3; repointed from the flows by saas-bootstrap-engine BE4, ported
# from cirrus).
#
# `blueprint.yaml` is the contract the platform's bootstrap door reads and the
# console renders screen for screen. A manifest that drifts is a console that
# lies — showing an operator secrets that will not be created, or a programme
# that will not be laid out, with nothing failing until a customer's build is
# already running.
#
# Every check compares the manifest to THE THING THAT DOES THE WORK, never to
# another copy of the same claim. `spec.source.tag` sat at `baseline-v1` against
# a live `baseline-v4` for three releases (and `baseline-v17` against
# `baseline-v27` in lumen — ten) because nothing compared it to anything that
# moved. A drift test between two files catches nothing.
#
# ## What the thing that does the work IS, now
#
# It used to be shell: `flows/common/create-secrets.sh`'s `create` calls, and
# the umbrella's `ensure-milestone` lines, grepped out of scripts. BE4 deleted
# those, and the work moved into `repo-blueprint.yaml` — so this file now reads
# the blueprint's own hooks.
#
# That is a STRONGER comparison, not a weaker one. Grepping a shell script for
# `create FOO cloudflare … workers-deploy` matched a line's shape; reading
# `orun.integrations/reconcile@v1`'s `with:` reads the declaration orun actually
# executes. The action's own documentation says as much — "a script walks that
# table calling create for each … it is a reconcile written out longhand, and
# this is the verb it was reaching for".
#
# TWO SHAPES OF REPO, one test. A repo may carry more than one baseline: stratus
# serves both the `stratus` and `stratus-coolify` registry rows from one tree.
# So every `blueprint*.yaml` at the root is checked.
#
# And a baseline need not have every mechanism. Stratus mints no secrets and
# lays out no milestones, so it declares neither block. That is allowed — but
# only BOTH-OR-NEITHER, checked in both directions: if the mechanism exists the
# block must match it, and if the block exists the mechanism must be there to
# realize it. "Absent" is never permission to skip a check silently; it is a
# fact that must agree with the other side.
