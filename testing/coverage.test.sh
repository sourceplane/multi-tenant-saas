# `repo-blueprint.yaml` decides what a product is made of. A component that no
# module names is not a component a product gets — and nothing would say so.
# The failure is quiet and late: the fork builds, its CI goes green, and the
# missing piece surfaces when somebody looks for a worker that was never
# copied.
#
# orun already enforces the other half — every MODULE belongs to exactly one
# phase, and a module naming an unknown module is a parse error. What it cannot
# know is what this repository contains, because a blueprint declares what to
# place and not what exists. That is this file's job.

# relative path. So `apps/admin-worker/wrangler.jsonc` matches nothing at all —
# no segment is ever equal to it — and the entry is INERT while reading exactly
# like a rule.
#
# That was not hypothetical. Twelve such entries were inert in cirrus's
# blueprint, copied from this one, and a canary written to `apps/admin-worker/wrangler.jsonc` was
# placed straight into a product — which is the leak their comment says they
# exist to prevent. An `ignore` list that silently does nothing is worse than
# no list, because the comment above it reads as a defence.
