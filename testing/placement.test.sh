# TIER 1, THE OTHER HALF — the tree is placed, branded, and made to answer
# (saas-bootstrap-engine BE5b; ported from cirrus).
#
# BE5a could only gate the DERIVED placement: a whole-blueprint `orun new`
# refused before writing a byte, because every phase's `requires` was checked
# up front and `02-foundation` asked whether `01-scaffold` was on disk during
# the run about to write it. orun BE-O11 fixed that, and BE-O12 fixed what it
# then exposed — that a BRANDED predecessor reads `drifted`, which the gate was
# refusing, and which `--resume` was silently overwriting back to the baseline.
#
# So this file does what the design's Tier 1 asks and BE5a could not:
#
#   1. place the whole blueprint from tests/fixtures/acme.json, offline;
#   2. assert the gates orun runs INSIDE that placement actually ran — the
#      two-parser check on every generated component.yaml, and `orun validate`
#      + `orun plan --dry-run` in the produced tree. They come free with a
#      placement, which is exactly why they need asserting: a future orun that
#      stopped running them would weaken this tier in silence, and BE1a exists
#      because that already happened once with a version pin;
#   3. brand it as `01-scaffold`'s hook chain does, then `rebrand.mjs --verify`;
#   4. run the leak rules over the REAL FILES rather than the derivation;
#   5. check the API base the product ends up with against the rule
#      `blueprint.yaml` states as its `derive` — the last mile of BE3's gate,
#      in the product;
#   6. THE PHASED SEQUENCE THROUGH A REBRAND: place 01, brand, then place the
#      phases that follow. This is the step no test in this repository has ever
#      taken, and it is where BE-O12's two defects lived.
#
# Needs: orun (the pinned version) + node + python3 + git. No network, no
# credential. Nothing here contacts a provider: placement writes files, and
# since BE-O12 a run with hooks off does not probe.
