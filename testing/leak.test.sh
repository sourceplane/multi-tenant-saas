# THE LEAK GATE — what a product carries, and what stays in the factory
# (saas-bootstrap-engine BE5, Tier 1; ported from cirrus).
#
# `BOOTSTRAP.md` describes a product as the thing this baseline makes, not a
# copy of it. Until now the `ai-context` module copied the whole of `ai/`, so
# every product shipped this repository's planning state and reports, which
# after rebrand read as statements about the CUSTOMER's product, in the file
# an agent is pointed at first. And the `flows`, `agents`, `tooling` and
# `root-forking` modules shipped the factory itself — FORKING.md included,
# the playbook for forking a baseline the product's owner has never seen.
#
# WHAT THIS ASKS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT YET. It asks orun to DERIVE the placement
# — every file every phase would write — and gates that set. Derivation runs no
# hooks, contacts nothing and writes nothing.
#
# It does NOT place the tree and brand it; `testing/placement.test.sh` does.
#
# Needs: orun (the pinned version) + python3. No network, no credential.
