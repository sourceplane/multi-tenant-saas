# Phase 02 — foundation

Lands the **shared packages** — thirteen modules (`repo-blueprint.yaml`,
phase `02-foundation`) — that everything later builds on. Nothing deploys and no
provider connection is needed — the PR's verify lanes (turbo builds and
tests) are the whole gate, run once on the PR and again on `main`.

## What it lands

`packages/`: `cli`, `contracts`, `db`, `notifications-client`,
`policy-engine`, `sdk`, `shared`, `testing`, `webhook-verifier` — plus the
test suites for `contracts`, `db`, `notifications-client` and
`policy-engine` under `tests/`. Each is a `turbo-package` component whose
lanes build and test it in CI.

`packages/db` carries the Postgres schema and its migrations, but nothing
applies them yet: the migration runner (`infra/db-migrate`) lands in
`03-infrastructure-database`, once there is a database to apply them to.

## Inputs

`--out` is the product repo. The blueprint's required inputs — `reponame`,
`productname`, `productdomain`, `githuborg` — are validated before any phase
runs, so pass them on every invocation; the product's own
`.rebrand/values.json` is a complete values file. See
[the phases README](README.md#inputs).

## Steps

1. **requires** — `01-scaffold` must be placed in `--out`.
2. **pre** — `orun.task/ensure@v1`: this phase's task under the epic.
3. **place** — the engine writes this phase's modules into `--out`. They
   arrive speaking the baseline's names, because `01-scaffold`'s rebrand ran
   before they existed.
4. **brand** — `git add -A` → `rebrand.mjs --values .rebrand/values.json` →
   `git add -A` → `rebrand.mjs --verify`, which refuses a landing with the
   baseline's identity left in it.
5. **component docs** — `tooling/docs/render-component-docs.py` re-renders
   every component's pages from the manifests now in the tree. The product's
   CI runs the same script with `--check` before it plans anything, and the
   pages as the baseline rendered them describe the whole fleet ("Depended on
   by" lists workers this phase has not placed), so without this step the
   phase's own PR is red.
6. **lockfile** — `pnpm install --lockfile-only`. `01-scaffold` wrote the
   lockfile for the projects that existed then, and the lanes install with
   `--frozen-lockfile`; without this step every package was refused before
   a test ran (`ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`).
7. **land** — `orun.pr/land@v1`: PR `phase(02-foundation): shared packages`,
   waits for its verify lanes, merges.
8. **converge** — `orun.run/watch@v1` (an `await` hook) watches the run for
   the merged commit and resumes transient lanes up to three times.

## Verify / done means

The main convergence run is green — every package builds and its tests
pass in the product repo.

## Troubleshooting

- **PR lanes fail building a package**: the baseline's packages are
  self-contained; a failure here usually means a partial placement (re-run
  the phase — placement is additive) or lockfile drift.
- **`ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`**: the lockfile step did not run or did not
  land. Re-run the phase; `pnpm install --lockfile-only` is idempotent.
- **`rebrand --verify` refuses**: a placed file still carries the baseline's
  identity. The message names the file. That is a rebrand rule missing in
  this baseline, not something to hand-edit in the product.
- **The landing picks up edits you did not intend**: commit or stash your
  local changes in the product repo before running a phase.
  `orun.pr/land@v1` lands what is in the tree, and a phase is meant to land
  its own modules, not your work in progress.

## Example commands

From the baseline checkout:

```bash
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml --out $HOME/sourceplane/acme \
  --run-hooks --phase 02-foundation \
  --values $HOME/sourceplane/acme/.rebrand/values.json
```

Headless (fresh container / no checkout — see BOOTSTRAP.md §2): clone the
baseline at a tag and run the same command, with `ORUN_TOKEN` +
`GITHUB_TOKEN` exported:

```bash
export ORUN_TOKEN="$(orun auth token | tail -1)" GITHUB_TOKEN=…
git clone --depth 1 --branch <baseline-tag> https://github.com/sourceplane/multi-tenant-saas
cd multi-tenant-saas
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml --out /work/acme \
  --run-hooks --phase 02-foundation --values /work/acme.values.yaml
```

Preview with zero side effects: drop `--run-hooks` — the phase places files
and stops, with no landing, no convergence watch and no probe. `--status`
derives every phase's state and writes nothing at all. Re-running a
completed phase is safe: the placement is a no-op, the landing finds
nothing new, and the `await` hooks re-assert.
